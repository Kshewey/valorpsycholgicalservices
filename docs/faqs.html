        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>What can I expect on my first visit?</ul>
            <p>The first visit is always an intake. Most clients bring paperwork or have sent me paperwork, but as a clinician, I value people and hearing their stories. You are much more than paperwork or a number to me, and I can't get to know you or how you felt about something, from a piece of paper. It is often hard for clients to go back over their stories with a new clinician, but I like to know as much as possible about children and their families so that I can be helpful. I also try to use the first visit to help you determine if you believe I will be a good fit. </p>
          <li>What insurance do you accept?​</li>
            <p>Please call us to find out abut the status of your insurance company. We are also happy to work with you to gain access to single-provider agreements.</p>
          <li>Do you have a sliding scale?</li>
            <p>We do have a sliding scale. We firmly believe that money should not prevent access to mental health care. ​</p>
          <li>How long will my child/I be in treatment?</li>
            <p>Mental health is very different than physical health, although the two are tied together. I do not place a timeline on mental health, but work with you to determine your needs. </p>
          <li>What is confidentiality? Do you review it with kids and parents? </li>
            <p>Confidentiality means that what is said in a session stays in a session. I review confidentiality and its limits  in paperwork and then again at first sessions, both with kids and parents, no matter their age. </p>
          <li>How long are appointments?</li>
            <p>Individual appointments are typically one hour long. Family appointments can be an hour and  a half long, depending on the number of family members present.</p>
          <li>How do I get in touch with Dr. Shewey?</li>
            <p>You may call Dr. Shewey or email her. If it's an emergency, call 911 or go to the ER.</p>
          <li>Can we be Facebook friends? Instagram? Snapchat?</li>
            <p>We adore all of our clients, but we cannot be friends on any social media. </p>
